# Transfer-learning-open-data

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Transfer-learning-open-data is to use BirdNET transfer
learning on open datasets for classification and automated detection

# Supervised classification using catâ€™s meow dataset

Data is described here: <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-67835-7_20>

## Methods

Randomly divided the data into a 70/30 split with 70% used for training
and 30% used for testing. Use BirdNET transfer learning to train and
subsequently classify the test dataset.
